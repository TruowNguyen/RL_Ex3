Exercise 3. Implement Q-learning for a Tic Tac Toe game with board sizes 4x4 and 5x5,
and plot the win rate of your agent. Beside, you have to answer the following questions:
• What happens if we initially train Q-learning using random exploration, then follow
up by training with SARSA and TD methods from last week? Should we retrain from
scratch, partially retrain, or continue training from the previous state?
• Is it possible to use a curriculum learning approach? Can we use the sates from 3x3
board to train for 4x4, and then progressing to 5x5?
